## Run the script

First, you need to install the dependencies :

```bash
  npm i
```

Then, modify the .env file by adding your user token and configuring the various required options.

```env
owners=YOUR ID
token=TOKEN OF YOUR BOT
color=COLOR OF YOUR BOT
prefix=PREFIX OF YOUR BOT
clientId=ID OF YOUR BOT
```

Finally, you can just run `node .` and wait.
